### Summary
The project involves coding an automatic series of movements for the robot. In addition to the robot, a motor and light sensors are linked up through the use of a board. Working together, the robot will collect a ball, travel forward to the next robot, and the light sensor would be covered, releasing a ball that is transferred to the next robot.

### What Worked
The construction of the ramp itself was not difficult at all, and communication with the rest of the class was on point, which allowed for efficient collecting and transferring of the golf ball. The ball dropped in very smoothly from the previous team, and the transferring would have been better if the ramp was built to be slightly longer.

### What Didn't Work
The servo motor was not very powerful, so our ramp needs to be very light; the light sensor was not responding nearly as effectively as the lighting in the classrooms and nolop; the board started acting strangely and wasnâ€™t behaving the way it is supposed to; the roombas are having issues connecting to the wifi.
