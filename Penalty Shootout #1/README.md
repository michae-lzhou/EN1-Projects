### Summary
The project involves coding an automatic series of movements for the robot. In addition to the robot, a motor and light sensors are linked up through the use of a breadboard. Working together, the motor releases a ball when activated by the light sensor, and the robot will attempt to shoot into the goal.

### What Worked
The laser cut-out of the first prototype of the ramp worked as intended, and the designing process was a breeze. We also learned how to hook up the wires in the circuits really quickly, which helped us understand electricity and circuitry. Our motor was triggered by the change in LED lights on the Roomba, and gravity is used to our advantage to allow a faster, more accurate shot towards the goal.

### What Didn't Work
The robot and the battery pack were a little uncooperative at times, which led to some frustration, but overall, everything worked as intended.
