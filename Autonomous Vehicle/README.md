### Summary
This project involves extensive CADing and intensive programming knowledge to complete. Living hinges and tabs were used to put together a 3D model of a car; the ROS code commanded the robot to move autonomously dependent on the distance of the car in front.

### What Worked
The 3D model of the car was very well put together, and the living hinges along with the tabs really bring out the shape and make the car come to life.

### What Didn't Work
The ROS code for talking to the Create wasnâ€™t working on the day of the presentation, although it theoretically should be working. There seemed to be a connection issue to the robot and the code for the program would get stuck waiting for a response.
