### Summary
This project’s goal is to be able to control the Create through buttons on a phone. In order to accomplish this, many different platforms were needed to. First and foremost, the robot needs to be connected to JupyterLabs through ros, from which it will be able to access data from an AirTable, dictating its movements. Lastly, Thunkable comes into play by having the ability to access and alter the data presented in the AirTable live, therefore indirectly controlling the movement of the Create.

### What Worked
JupyterLabs is able to communicate with the create and the AirTable relatively smoothly, though there were a couple hiccups here and there. Furthermore, Thunkable was able to access and present the data from AirTable very well.

### What Didn't work
There were a lot of logistic and syntactic errors in the starter code we were provided with, which required hours of troubleshooting and figuring out. Furthermore, the connections from the AirTable to JupyterLabs and then to the Create was not the smoothest, as WiFi connection strongly dictates whether the Create moved or not. Lastly, I had a lot of issue with updating the values within AirTable through Thunkable; I was able to update the values, but there was a major — and inconsistent — delay between the press of a button and the change reflecting in AirTable. This delay was further exacerbated when a phone was used to connect to AirTable, which caused a lot of confusion and frustration.
