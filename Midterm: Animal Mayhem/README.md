### Summary
using MakerPi to link up light sensors and a motor to perform an action. The theme of the project is animals, where I decided to make a cute dog. I placed the light sensor on top of its head, so that when a person “pets” the dog (covers the top of its head), the dog will wag its tails.

### What Worked
The laser cutting process went very smoothly, and the CADing process was simplified greatly — I uploaded an image into OnShape and traced through it. Furthermore, the code used to run the motor was figured out relatively quickly, and everything was assembled smoothly. I also reused some of the code I wrote for previous projects to help with the light sensor code.

### What Didn't Work
I really really wanted to make the dog whine when the light sensor is covered/not covered. I tried two methods, strictly using the beeping sound on the MakerPi to play a sound through different frequencies and uploading an audio file of a dog whining to the MakerPi itself. However, I could not figure out a way to upload an audio file to the MakerPi, and the beeping sounds with varying frequencies did not sound like a dog whining at all.
