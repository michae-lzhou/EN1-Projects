### Summary
For this project, the main focus was to connect the robot to the computer and give it commands, such as beeping, changing LED lights, and moving. The objective of the project was to allow the robot to run four bases and turn at each base. Approaching the projects deadline, however, there was a software issue with the robot, preventing it from moving. Thus it became more of a decorating project as opposed to a functional project.

### What Worked
It was great working together with teammates, and I really appreciated how proactive my teammates have been. We worked together and distributed the work evenly on the designing process.

### What Didn't Work
We struggled to connect to the robot many times, and we ultimately got it to change its LED lights and beep after attending many many hours of office hours. However, we could not get the robot to move, which was removed from the requirements of the assignment.
