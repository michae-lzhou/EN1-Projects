### Summary
For this project, the main focus was to connect the robot to the computer and give it commands, such as beeping, changing LED lights, and moving. The objective of the project was to allow the robot to run four bases and turn at each base. Approaching the projects deadline, however, there was a software issue with the robot, preventing it from moving. Thus it became more of a decorating project as opposed to a functional project.
