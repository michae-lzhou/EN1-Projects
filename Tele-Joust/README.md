### Summary
For this project, we built a rudimentary model of a knight with jousts and set them on top of a robot to fight each other over a short wall. I implemented basic movement codes and used keyboard inputs to navigate the robot, making it turn and move forward and backward. The joust itself involved two robots moving towards each other with jousts sticking out of the front, trying to knock each otherâ€™s knights off of the robot.

### What Worked
We got started earlier than the last project, getting the bulk of the building part done over the weekend. We discussed about the work and divided it evenly, 3D printing the knight helmet over the span of two days.

### What Didn't Work
We never got the robot to move, once again, but it was not part of the requirement of the project, since there are two working robots, and all we needed to do is to replace the top lid of the robot.
