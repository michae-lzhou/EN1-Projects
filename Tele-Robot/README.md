### Summary
This project focused on the building process, since the phone holder was to be designed and modeled using OnShape or alternate tools. On that note, we also learned to use the 3D printer and the laser cutter for making the essential parts for our project. While decoration was not mandatory, I quickly sketched Nemo and sticked it onto the back of the phone holder.

### What Worked
The 3D printing process was very smooth, and there was no issue assembling the parts. The driving process was very smooth as well, there was minimal lag and the phone holder was very well-constructed in terms of simplicity and effectiveness.

### What Didn't Work
We were able to connect to our robot several times, but the WiFi connection kept breaking, so we ultimately replaced the robot and placed the top lid on a working robot.
