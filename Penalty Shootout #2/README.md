### Summary
This project involves connecting the robot and the MakerPi board through serial, and controlling the MakerPi board through the create using JupyterLab. Instead of running and uploading a functioning program in the web REPL as main.py, a separate function without any function calls is uploaded onto the MakerPi board. This allowed the python code to be called from JupyterLab through the create, shooting a ball into the goal after the create drives forward.

### What Worked
Some things that worked really well for this project is the design of the leg. The overall aesthetics was very clean and neat, with no rough edges or unclean cuts on the wood. All wires and connections are secure and not loose. Additionally, the functionality of the leg is satisfactory, as the ball is launched forward and rolls gracefully into the goal as expected.

### What Didn't Work
During the project, we spent an unreasonably large amount of time to find a pair of screws that would combine the motor and the leg. Many times, the screw we found would be just too short or just too thick. At the end, we settled on mixing and matching different screws that barely fit together to hold everything together. Furthermore, serial connection between the robot and the MakerPi board was not working, so ultimately we were directed to upload a main.py function onto MakerPi to rotate the motor and shoot the ball. For our group specifically, the motor acted funky and was refusing to rotate when we thought it was a software issue. However, shortly after we resolved the motor issue, errors popped up in the python code itself that wasnâ€™t there before, which prohibited us to actually use the motor.
